This R markdown document will highlight the process used to estimate a mixture model from the underlying population data.
The data has:

* 8000 members;
* data generated from 2 separate beta distributions

I need to:

* Find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for the parameters of each component beta distribution
* Find the percentage of the data coming from each component beta distribution (5 parameters in total).

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
